Simple Kubernetes operator for handling `Expression` CRDs.

> Use Kubernetes for evaluating arbitrary expressions.

[Kubernetes operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) implementation using the [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) library.

If you like this topic, you can find the detailed explanation on how this operator was implemented (not only the code, but also the CRD, RBAC, Deply manifests, the Makefile, Dockerfile and the Github Action for releasing) in my [Using `client-go` notebook](https://leanpub.com/using-client-go) notebook [available here](https://leanpub.com/using-client-go).
